When you read a csv with pandas, pandas does its best to sniff out what data type each field should be. However, it doesn’t always get it right. For example, here is a csv with a zip_code field for US postal codes. Even though the values are all numbers, we may want to model them as strings (or, in the language of pandas, as objects)
Instead of letting pandas guess, we can tell it exactly what data type any or all of the fields in a csv should be, using the ```dtype``` parameter in ```read_csv```
```dtype``` takes a dictionary, where each key is a field and each value is the data type that field should be. Here, we ensure ZIP codes are strings with the following code:
